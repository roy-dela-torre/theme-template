To maximize performance and SEO with this theme, consider the following:

- **SEO-Friendly Headers:**  
    Use semantic HTML header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) in your templates and content. Ensure each page has a single `<h1>` and logical heading structure for accessibility and SEO.

- **Image Optimization:**  
    - Compress images before uploading.  
    - Ensure individual image files are ideally under 500KB and never exceed 1MB.  
    - Use modern formats like WebP where possible.  
    - Add descriptive `alt` text to all images for accessibility and SEO.

- **Additional Tips:**  
    - Use an SEO plugin (e.g., Yoast SEO or Rank Math) for meta tags and sitemap generation.  
    - Minimize the use of heavy plugins and scripts.  
    - Enable caching and use a CDN for faster load times.

Following these practices will help your site remain fast, accessible, and search engine friendly.
