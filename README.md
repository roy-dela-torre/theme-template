## Optimization Tips

To maximize performance and SEO:

- **SEO-Friendly Headers:**  
    Use semantic HTML header tags (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) in your templates. Ensure each page has a single `<h1>` and a logical heading structure for accessibility and SEO.

- **Image Optimization:**  
    - Compress images before uploading  
    - Keep image files under 500KB (never exceed 1MB)  
    - Use modern formats like WebP  
    - Add descriptive `alt` text for accessibility and SEO

- **Additional Tips:**  
    - Use an SEO plugin (e.g., Yoast SEO or Rank Math) for meta tags and sitemaps  
    - Minimize heavy plugins and scripts  
    - Enable caching and use a CDN for faster load times

Following these practices will help keep your site fast, accessible, and search engine friendly.

## Template File Guidance

To create custom templates for custom post types, use the following naming conventions:

- `single-slug.php` – For single post type entries
- `archive-slug.php` – For post type archives

Replace `slug` with your custom post type’s slug.
